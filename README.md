# What is Java Programming ?

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies. Created in 1995.

## Uses of Java
- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- It has a large demand in the current job market
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast and powerful
- It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

# [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](https://www.javatpoint.com/jvm-java-virtual-machine)

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).

### Operations 

- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment
- JVM provides definitions for the :
    1. Memory area
    2. Class file format
    3. Register set
    4. Garbage-collected heap
    5. Fatal error reporting etc.
